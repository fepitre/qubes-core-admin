"""API for various types of devices.

Main concept is that some domain may
expose (potentially multiple) devices, which can be attached to other domains.
Devices can be of different buses (like 'pci', 'usb', etc.). Each device
bus is implemented by an extension.

Devices are identified by pair of (backend domain, `ident`), where `ident` is
:py:class:`str` and can contain only characters from `[a-zA-Z0-9._-]` set.

Such extension should:
 - provide `qubes.devices` endpoint - a class descendant from
   :py:class:`qubes.device_protocol.DeviceInfo`, designed to hold device
   description (including bus-specific properties)
 - handle `device-attach:bus` and `device-detach:bus` events for
   performing the attach/detach action; events are fired even when domain isn't
   running and extension should be prepared for this; handlers for those events
   can be coroutines
 - handle `device-list:bus` event - list devices exposed by particular
   domain; it should return a list of appropriate DeviceInfo objects
 - handle `device-get:bus` event - get one device object exposed by this
   domain of given identifier
 - handle `device-list-attached:bus` event - list devices currently attached
   to this domain
 - fire `device-list-change:bus` and following `device-added:bus` or
   `device-removed:bus` events when a device list change is detected
   (new/removed device)

Note that device-listing event handlers cannot be asynchronous. This for
example means you cannot call qrexec service there. This is intentional to
keep device listing operation cheap. You need to design the extension to take
this into account (for example by using QubesDB).

Extension may use QubesDB watch API (QubesVM.watch_qdb_path(path), then handle
`domain-qdb-change:path`) to detect changes and fire
`device-list-change:class` event.

    This class emits following events on VM object:

        .. event:: device-added:<class> (device)

            Fired when new device is discovered.

        .. event:: device-removed:<class> (device)

            Fired when device is no longer exposed by a backend VM.

        .. event:: device-attach:<class> (device, options)

            Fired when device is attached to a VM.

            Handler for this event may be asynchronous.

            :param device: :py:class:`DeviceInfo` object to be attached
            :param options: :py:class:`dict` of attachment options

        .. event:: device-pre-attach:<class> (device)

            Fired before device is attached to a VM

            Handler for this event may be asynchronous.

            :param device: :py:class:`DeviceInfo` object to be attached

        .. event:: device-detach:<class> (device)

            Fired when device is detached from a VM.

            Handler for this event can be asynchronous (a coroutine).

            :param device: :py:class:`DeviceInfo` object to be attached

        .. event:: device-pre-detach:<class> (device)

            Fired before device is detached from a VM

            :param device: :py:class:`DeviceInfo` object to be attached

        .. event:: device-assign:<class> (device, options)

            Fired when device is assigned to a VM.

            :param device: :py:class:`DeviceInfo` object to be assigned
            :param options: :py:class:`dict` of assignment options

            Fired when device is unassigned from a VM.

            Handler for this event can be asynchronous (a coroutine).

            :param device: :py:class:`DeviceInfo` object to be unassigned

        .. event:: device-list:<class>

            Fired to get list of devices exposed by a VM. Handlers of this
            event should return a list of py:class:`DeviceInfo` objects (or
            appropriate class specific descendant)

        .. event:: device-get:<class> (ident)

            Fired to get a single device, given by the `ident` parameter.
            Handlers of this event should either return appropriate object of
            :py:class:`DeviceInfo`, or :py:obj:`None`. Especially should not
            raise :py:class:`exceptions.KeyError`.

        .. event:: device-list-attached:<class>

            Fired to get list of currently attached devices to a VM. Handlers
            of this event should return list of devices actually attached to
            a domain, regardless of its settings.
